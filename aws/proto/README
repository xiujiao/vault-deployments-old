Environment Definitions (aws/proto)

This directory contains templates that describe the environment-specific
settings of a single deployment.  These templates will be combined with
the global and site templates to produce a single BOSH manifest for deployment
purposes.  The templates are merged in the following order:

  monitoring.yml              Configure whatever (external) monitoring system you
                              want to track the performance and health of your
                              deployment.

  networking.yml              Configure the network numbering for this deployment.

  director.yml                Identify the BOSH director UUID for this deployment.

  scaling.yml                 Define the scaling properties for this deployment,
                              including things like the number of instances, sizes
                              of persistent disks, resource pool limits, etc.

  properties.yml              Define properties (both globally and per-job),
                              that are specific to this environment.  These will
                              most likely override global and site properties.

  credentials.yml             Define passwords and credentials here, so that they
                              are centralized.  Keep in mind that commiting these
                              into version control incurs some security risk.

  cloudfoundry.yml            For deployments that integrate with Cloud Foundry
                              installations (i.e. as service brokers), you can
                              specify the integration details here, including
                              things like the CF API, credentials, domains, etc.

  name.yml                    Specify the name of this deployment.


This directory also contains a Makefile that makes it easier to build
the final BOSH manifest from all of the constituent templates.
Run `make' to see some help, or `make manifest' to just rebuild.
